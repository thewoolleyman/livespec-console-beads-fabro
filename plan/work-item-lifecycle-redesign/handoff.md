# Handoff — work-item-lifecycle-redesign

Single resumable execution-coordination point for this planning thread. A
fresh session that opens ONLY this file and follows the read-first chain can
proceed to the next action without re-deriving anything or consulting chat
history.

## Ledger status anchor (read-only)

- **Console epic:** `livespec-console-beads-fabro-vqh36l` (this tenant).
- **Parent fleet epic (cross-repo, prose link only):** `livespec-35s3zo`
  (livespec core tenant).
- Live status is **composed from the ledger** — never shadowed here. To see
  current state run, under the family env wrapper, the orchestrator
  `list-work-items` / `next` operations against this repo's tenant. This
  handoff embeds **no** `[ ]`/`[x]` work queue.

## Read-first chain (in order)

1. `plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/README.md` — thread overview, walk
   order, status.
2. `plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/research/locked-core-contract.md` —
   the fixed inputs from livespec core (states, `lane_of`, the
   `lane`/`lane_reason` emission, the console hard constraints, post-merge
   acceptance). These are **referenced, not re-decided**.
3. `plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/research/boundary.md` — the
   core-owns-contract / console-owns-how seam and the spec-hygiene rule.
4. `plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/research/console-recon.md` — current
   console state (crate layout + the 6 findings).
5. `plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/research/e-decomposition.md` — the
   E-1..E-4 decisions, each with a leading recommendation, and the walk
   order.

When a decision-log note exists at
`plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/research/decision-log.md`, read it after
the chain above — it carries the resolved E-decisions and supersedes the
recommendations in `e-decomposition.md`.

## Working model (how to proceed)

- **Proceed** (recommend + act, no stop) on parts **forced or clearly
  implied by the locked core contract**.
- **Stop and surface as PLAIN TEXT** (no AskUserQuestion pickers) only on
  **genuine design decisions** — then wait for the maintainer's answer
  relayed by the core session.
- After each E decision: record it in
  `plan/work-item-lifecycle-redesign/research/decision-log.md` and update
  this handoff's **Next action** so the thread stays resumable.
- Repo discipline: all changes via **worktree → PR** (per `AGENTS.md`);
  never `--no-verify`; on a hook failure, halt and report. Do not modify
  other repos or touch branches this thread did not create.

## Next action (exactly one path)

**E walk COMPLETE — the next step is MAINTAINER-OWNED; do NOT auto-start it.**
All four decisions (E-1, E-2, E-3, E-4) are RESOLVED and recorded in
[research/decision-log.md](research/decision-log.md).

**Next action: groom epic `livespec-console-beads-fabro-vqh36l` into
dispatchable, console-local implementation slices** (via the orchestrator
`groom` operation). This is a **maintainer-owned step** — a resuming agent must
**not** begin grooming on its own. Grooming cuts the resolved E-1..E-4 design
into ready, dependency-layered slices (e.g. E-1 source/ingestion + `Beads*`
rename; E-2 hybrid lane view; E-3 attention-as-derivation + snooze/ack
deletion; E-4 conformance test), each carrying its own autonomy tier and
acceptance, filed as children of the epic.

This thread is design/planning only — **no Rust changes** were made.
