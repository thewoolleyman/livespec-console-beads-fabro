# Spec-check & CI discipline (console)

Durable, learned agent knowledge for `livespec-console-beads-fabro`,
loaded on demand from `AGENTS.md`. Captured after a session where a
"spec-only" PR was wrongly declared a pre-existing/environmental CI
failure without reading the log.

## A "spec-only" change CAN break Rust CI in this repo

`crates/console-spec-check/src/tests.rs` has
`extract_rules_matches_real_spec_ground_truth`. It reads the **real**
`SPECIFICATION/` files and asserts the normative-clause (`MUST`/`SHOULD`)
count per file as pinned ground truth, for:
`spec.md`, `contracts.md`, `constraints.md`,
`non-functional-requirements.md` (plus a `total`).

Any spec revision that adds/removes normative clauses in those files
changes the counts and **fails this test** — and therefore `check-test`,
`check-nextest`, and `check-coverage` — even though only `SPECIFICATION/`
markdown changed. This is intentional: it forces a conscious ground-truth
update whenever the spec's clause surface moves.

**Rule: when a spec revision changes clause counts, update the pinned
counts in the SAME change.** Measure the real counts by running the
actual `extract_rules` over the revised spec (e.g. temporarily
`eprintln!` `extract_rules(file, &text).len()` per file, run
`cargo test -p console-spec-check <test> -- --nocapture`), then set the
`cases` array and the `total` assertion (and the comment). Never assume
"spec-only ⇒ no Rust impact" here. Example: the v013 full-autonomous-mode
revision moved spec/contracts/constraints `3/20/7` → `14/32/18`,
total `82` → `116`.

## Read the actual CI log before attributing a cause

Never label a CI failure "pre-existing" or "environmental" from
inference — read the failing job's log first.

- `gh run view <run> --log-failed` sometimes returns **empty** on this
  project. That is a `gh` quirk, NOT missing observability — do not give
  up when it happens.
- Reliable retrieval:
  `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/{job_id}/logs`
  (get `job_id` from `gh run view <run> --json jobs`), or
  `gh run view <run> --log` for the full log.
- `gh run view <run> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | select(.name|test("<job>")) | .steps[] | "[\(.conclusion)] \(.name)"'`
  shows WHICH step failed (setup vs. the actual test step).

## A local test run is only evidence if it's the SAME commit CI tested

`cargo test` passing locally proves nothing unless the working tree is
the exact commit CI ran. The primary checkout is usually on `master`;
spec/feature work lives on `spec/*` branches in worktrees, so a bare
`cargo test` in the primary checkout tests master, not the branch. Check
out (or worktree) the CI'd SHA before saying "passes locally."

## Commit / push mechanics

- Commits and pushes are **refused at the primary checkout** (baseline
  worktree-discipline hook: refuses when `git-dir == git-common-dir`).
  Work from a git worktree.
- The pre-push hook runs the full `just check` gate. Push **through** it
  (no `--no-verify`) so a local pass guarantees CI passes; only bypass
  for a genuinely unrelated failure you have verified independently.
- The repo allows **rebase merges only** (no squash, no merge commit) —
  `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`.
